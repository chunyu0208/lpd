## Overview
The **Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD)** project focuses on improving the efficiency of autoregressive image generation. By leveraging locality-aware techniques, we can significantly speed up the decoding process while maintaining high-quality output. This repository includes implementations and benchmarks to showcase the effectiveness of our approach.

For the latest releases, visit [Releases](https://github.com/chunyu0208/lpd/releases).

## Features
- **Acceleration**: Optimized for fast decoding.
- **Autoregressive**: Implements state-of-the-art autoregressive models.
- **Efficient Algorithm**: Utilizes locality-aware strategies for better performance.
- **Image Generation**: Capable of generating high-quality images.
- **ImageNet Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with ImageNet datasets.
- **Parallel Decoding**: Supports parallel processing to enhance speed.

## Installation
To get started with LPD, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chunyu0208/lpd.git
cd lpd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine.

## Usage
After installation, you can start using LPD for your image generation tasks. The main script is located in the `src` directory. 

To generate images, run the following command:

```bash
python src/generate.py --config config.yaml
```

Make sure to modify the `config.yaml` file according to your requirements. You can specify parameters such as the number of images to generate, output directory, and model checkpoints.

For detailed examples, refer to the [Examples](#examples) section.

## Architecture
The architecture of LPD is designed for efficiency and scalability. It consists of the following components:

1. **Data Loader**: Handles loading and preprocessing of image datasets.
2. **Model**: Implements the autoregressive model with locality-aware features.
3. **Decoder**: Responsible for the parallel decoding process.
4. **Evaluator**: Measures the quality of generated images.

Each component is modular, allowing for easy customization and extension.

## Examples
Here are a few examples of how to use LPD for image generation.

### Example 1: Generate a Single Image
To generate a single image, you can use the following command:

```bash
python src/generate.py --config config_single.yaml
```

### Example 2: Generate Multiple Images
To generate multiple images at once, modify the `config_multiple.yaml` file:

```bash
python src/generate.py --config config_multiple.yaml
```

### Example 3: Customizing Output
You can customize the output size and format by adjusting parameters in the configuration file. 

Refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/chunyu0208/lpd/docs) for more examples and detailed explanations.
